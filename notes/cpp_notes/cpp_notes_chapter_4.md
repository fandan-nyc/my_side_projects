# A tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms

# Libraries
* the facilities provided by the standard library can be classified as
  * run time language support (for allocation, runtime type)
  * the c lib
  * strings and I/O stream
  * a framework of containers and algorithms
  * numeric computation
  * regular expression
  * concurrent programming
  * template metaprogramming
  * smart pointers
  * special purpose container
# String
* substr, replace, toupper, and you can == to compare
* +/+= concatenation

# Stream I/O
* cout
* cin
  * you can read the whole line by `getline(cin, local_var)`
* I/O stream for user defined types
